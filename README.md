# Application of Statistical ML Models
- We explored and implemented  the following models from scratch - HMM for Speech Recognition, also tried GMMHMM for this, where each state of the HMM is sampled from a gaussian distribution. GMM for Speaker Identification and clusterting of different speeches. HMM and CRF for POS tagging along with various techniques like mean, iterative ,most frequent and  randomized imputation for imputation of missing values, laplace smoothening smoothening the weights. Also compared the performance with library and got similar results.
- Please go through the report for the technical details and results.

# Instructions to run the code
1. Ensure that you have git installed in your system
2. In terminal type,
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/dhaneshragu/CS361-Course-Project.git
  ```
3. In the folder named `Dataset`, we have uploaded the datasets used for the tasks mentioned in report.
4. Go to `EDA` for Exploratory data analysis and follow the instructions in the `readme.md` there.
5. Go to `Digit-Recognition-with-GMMHMM` for GMM-HMM part.
6. Go to `Language-Recognition-with-GMM` for GMM part.
7. Go to `POS_Tagging-with-GMM-HMM` for CRF and HMM part.
